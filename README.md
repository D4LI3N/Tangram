**Tangram** is an engaging open-source 2D puzzle game that offers players three exciting levels, each adorned with captivating animal-themed shapes. The game features a remarkable animation that celebrates the completion of each level, bringing the shapes to life with vibrant visual animations. Notably, Tangram is built using core OpenGL instead of a game engine, highlighting its unique development approach. Its sleek design and user-friendly interface enhance the gameplay experience, while the inclusion of graphic options allows players to customize lighting effects and create their preferred ambience. Tangram offers a delightful combination of challenging puzzles, stunning visuals, and advanced graphics options, making it a must-play for puzzle enthusiasts.

# Project Features
- 3 unique levels
- 4 geometrical shapes
- graphical options
- controls display
- animations (after completion)
- 3D rotation of the 2D shape (after completion)

# Operation
## Setup
To get started with Tangram game, follow these steps:

- Download the game for the appropriate platform
- Transfer the game files onto a suitable media, such as a USB stick (platform dependent)
- Install the game on your device (platform dependent)
- Launch the game

## Usage
Upon launching the game, the first level is automatically initiated, allowing players to start playing using the following controls:

- WASD: Rotation and scale
- Q: Previous shape
- E: Next shape
- Choose shape:
  - 1: Triangle
  - 2: Square
  - 3: Parallelogram
  - 4: Parallelogram (flipped)
  - 0: Removes the shape
    
Once the shape has been assembled and the game is successfully completed, players are granted the ability to manipulate the assembled shape by rotating it in a three-dimensional space using the following controls:
- Arrow Keys

Buttons:
  - "Help": Shows help window
  - "Level <x>": Levels (3 levels avaliable)
  - "Check": During the game, players have the option to use the "Check" button, which provides feedback on whether the shape is correctly placed / rotated / resized



## Objective
The main objective of this Tangram game is to arrange a set of geometric shapes, called tans, to form specific figures. Players are presented with an initial silhouette or outline, and they must use their problem-solving skills to manipulate the tans, rotating and fitting them together, until they precisely match the given silhouette. The challenge lies in finding the right arrangement and orientation of the tans to create the desired shape, utilizing spatial awareness and logical thinking. With each level, the complexity of the figures increases, providing players with progressively more challenging puzzles to solve.
